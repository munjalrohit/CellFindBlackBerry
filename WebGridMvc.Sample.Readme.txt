Set up scripts

The simple way to ensure that the sample works is to make sure that the razor layout has jQuery referenced, and to also add the webGrid.js script:

    <script src="@Url.Content("~/Scripts/webGrid.js")" type="text/javascript"></script>


Run it

Assuming you have the default route mapping, navigate to ~/Products to get a series of links to the sample functionality :-)
